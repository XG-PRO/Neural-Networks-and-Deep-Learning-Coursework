# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-Coursework

Contains 3 seperate projects regarding neural networks completed using Jupyter Notebook.

All datasets derive from keras. Project 1 and 2 use MNIST, Project 3 uses Cifar10.

For each project, the Nearest Centroid and Nearest Neighbor Classifiers were used for comparison.

For the charts and graphs shown, numpy is used to compare results.

For greater understanding, read the comments inside the .ipynb files and read the .pptx presentation.

## Project 1

The first project creates models which use linear Deep neurons or Convolution2D neurons. Several variations are made with different variables to test and showcase results.

## Project 2

The second project creates an SVM classifier and passes through it a small set of data from MNIST. 

We run several experiments with different variables and amount of data to achieve better results.

## Project 3

The third project creates an autoencoder which utilizes a simple neural network in the Cifar10 dataset.

The initial structure of the encoder and decoder remain the same, however we run variations on the included neural model to achieve better results.

For direct comparison we also use PCA reconstruction and draw results.

# Conclusion

We gather data for all datasets and experiments and compare them with either Nearest Centroid and Nearest Neighbors or with PCA Reconstruction. We draw conclusions and showcase findings after initial experiments.

All results can be seen either in the noteboook files or the .pptx presentation.
